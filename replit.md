# WhatsApp Internship Application System

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to apply for internships through WhatsApp messaging. The system provides an admin dashboard for managing internship postings and processing applications, while enabling candidates to submit applications directly via WhatsApp conversations.

## System Architecture
