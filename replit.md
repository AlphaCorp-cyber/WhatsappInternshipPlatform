# WhatsApp Internship Application System

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to apply for internships through WhatsApp messaging. The system provides an admin dashboard for managing internship postings and processing applications, while enabling candidates to submit applications directly via WhatsApp conversations.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: SQLite (default) with PostgreSQL support via environment variables
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login for session management
- **File Handling**: Local file storage in `uploads/` directory
- **Communication**: Multi-channel support (WhatsApp, Email, SMS)

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 with Flask
- **CSS Framework**: Bootstrap 5 with dark theme
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS with Bootstrap components
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.4.0

## Key Components

### 1. Models (`models.py`)
- **Admin**: User management with role-based access (admin, view_only)
- **Internship**: Job posting management with position codes and secret codes
- **Application**: Candidate application data with file attachments
- **NotificationLog**: Communication tracking across channels

### 2. WhatsApp Integration (`whatsapp_handler.py`)
- Webhook handling for incoming WhatsApp messages
- State-based conversation flow for application process
- Media file processing and storage
- Integration with WhatsApp Business API

### 3. Communication System (`communication.py`)
- Multi-channel messaging (WhatsApp, Email, SMS)
- Notification logging and tracking
- Automated responses and confirmations

### 4. Admin Dashboard (`routes.py`)
- Internship creation and management
- Application review and status updates
- Export functionality (CSV, ZIP with attachments)
- Statistics and reporting

## Data Flow

### Application Process
1. Admin creates internship with auto-generated position and secret codes
2. Candidate sends WhatsApp message with codes to start application
3. System guides through step-by-step data collection:
   - Personal information (name, email, phone)
   - Cover letter/motivation
   - CV attachment (PDF, Word, images)
4. Application stored in database with file attachments
5. Confirmation sent to candidate via WhatsApp

### Admin Workflow
1. Login to dashboard with Flask-Login authentication
2. Create/manage internship postings
3. Review applications with filtering and search
4. Update application status with automated notifications
5. Export application data and attachments

## External Dependencies
